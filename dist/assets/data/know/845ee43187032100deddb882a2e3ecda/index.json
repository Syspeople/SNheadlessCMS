When this happens, sometimes the only solution is to issue a Force Quit command. Force quitting an application will not save your latest changes, but it will often allow you to revive the misbehaving application without restarting your entire computer.</p>\n<p>To force quit an application, from the Apple menu, choose <span class=\"menuitem\">Force Quit...</span>. Select the misbehaving application from the list, and then click <span class=\"menuitem\">Force quit</span>. You can also bring up this window by pressing <code>Command-Option-Esc</code>.</p>\n<p>Note: You cannot quit the Finder; the only option available to you is <span class=\"menuitem\">Relaunch</span>, which will reload the Finder.</p>\n<p> </p>"}},"context":{}}
