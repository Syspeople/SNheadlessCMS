The intent is to provide a seamless experience on desktops, laptops, tablets, and phone devices. <p>By default, the Start screen is displayed. Move your mouse pointer to the bottom left corner of the screen to make the <span class=\"menuitem\">Start</span> button appear. Click it to display the desktop; click it again to display the Start screen.</p> </li><li>8: The Start screen has a default application display you can customize: <br /><br /><ol><li>Right-click any app and the Application bar will appear at the bottom, with options for the application you have selected. </li><li>To add an app to the Start screen, click <span class=\"menuitem\">Pin to Start</span>.<br />    If an application is already on the Start screen, you&#39;ll see <span class=\"menuitem\">Unpin from Start</span> instead. </li></ol></li></ul> <h3>Power User menu</h3> <p>The Power User menu displays the most commonly used applications from the Control Panel, File Explorer, and Task Manager, as well as Restart, Run, Search, and Shutdown/Update. Access it in one of the following ways:</p> <ul><li>Press <code><a href=\"/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id&#61;3b07857187032100deddb882a2e3ec20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Win</a>-x</code>.</li><li>In 8.1, right-click the <span class=\"menuitem\">Start</span> button to launch the Power User menu.

Windows 8.x applications (formerly called &#34;metro&#34; style applications) have neither close nor minimize buttons; they are designed to run as full-screen applications and cannot be resized.</p> <ul><li>Tap the down arrow to view all apps (similar to viewing all programs in previous versions of Windows).<br />    Alternately, you can right-click an open area of the Start screen, and the Application bar will open at the bottom. Click <span class=\"menuitem\">All apps</span> on the lower right, and a list of all available apps will appear.</li><li>To close Windows 8.x applications, go to the top of the screen (your cursor will become a hand) and drag down to the bottom of the screen.</li></ul> <h3>Search Settings and other Charms</h3> <p>Options for accessing the Charms menu:</p> <ul><li>Tap the upper right-hand corner and move down to select a charm.</li><li>Hover your mouse pointer at the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft.</p>\n<p>One type of phishing attempt is an email message stating that you are receiving it due to fraudulent activity on your account, and asking you to &#34;click here&#34; to verify your information.</p>\n<p>Phishing scams are crude social engineering tools designed to induce panic in the reader. These scams attempt to trick recipients into responding or clicking immediately, by claiming they will lose something (e.g., email, bank account). Such a claim is always indicative of a phishing scam, as responsible companies and organizations will never take these types of actions via email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Specific types of phishing</strong></span></p>\n<p>Phishing scams vary widely in terms of their complexity, the quality of the forgery, and the attacker&#39;s objective. Several distinct types of phishing have emerged.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Spear phishing</span></h3>\n<p>Phishing attacks directed at specific individuals, roles, or organizations are referred to as &#34;spear phishing&#34;. Since these attacks are so pointed, attackers may go to great lengths to gather specific personal or institutional information in the hope of making the attack more believable and increasing the likelihood of its success.</p>\n<p>The best defense against spear phishing is to carefully, securely discard information (i.e., using a cross-cut shredder) that could be used in such an attack. Further, be aware of data that may be relatively easily obtainable (e.g., your title at work, your favorite places, or where you bank), and think before acting on seemingly random requests via email or phone.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Whaling</span></h3>\n<p>The term &#34;whaling&#34; is used to describe phishing attacks (usually spear phishing) directed specifically at executive officers or other high-profile targets within a business, government, or other organization.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Avoiding phishing scams</span></h2>\n<p>The Company and other reputable organizations will never use email to request that you reply with your passphrase, Social Security number, or confidential personal information. Be suspicious of any email message that asks you to enter or verify personal information, through a web site or by replying to the message itself. Never reply to or click the links in a message. If you think the message may be legitimate, go directly to the company&#39;s web site (i.e., type the real URL into your browser) or contact the company to see if you really do need to take the action described in the email message.</p>\n<p>When you recognize a phishing message, delete the email message from your Inbox, and then empty it from the deleted items folder to avoid accidentally accessing the web sites it points to.</p>\n<p>Always read your email as plain text.</p>\n<p>Phishing messages often contain clickable images that look legitimate; by reading messages in plain text, you can see the URLs that any images point to. Additionally, when you allow your mail client to read HTML or other non-text-only formatting, attackers can take advantage of your mail client&#39;s ability to execute code, which leaves your computer vulnerable to viruses, worms, and Trojans.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Warnings</strong></span></p>\n<p>Reading email as plain text is a general best practice that, while avoiding some phishing attempts, won&#39;t avoid them all. Some legitimate sites use redirect scripts that don&#39;t check the redirects. Consequently, phishing perpetrators can use these scripts to redirect from legitimate sites to their fake sites.</p>\n<p>Another tactic is to use a homograph attack, which, due to International Domain Name (IDN) support in modern browsers, allows attackers to use different languagecharacter sets to produce URLs that look remarkably like the authentic ones.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Reporting phishing attempts</span></h2>\n<ul><li>If the phishing attempt targets the Company in any way (e.g., asks for the Company&#39;s Webmail users to &#34;verify their accounts&#34;, includes a malicious PDF directed to human resources, or impersonates the Company), forward it with full headers to the Company Information Security Office. </li><li>You can report a phishing scam attempt to the company that is being spoofed. </li><li>You can also send reports to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </li><li>Depending on where you live, some local authorities also accept phishing scam reports. </li><li>Finally, you can send details to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which is building a database of common scams to which people can refer.</li></ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Example of a phishing scam</strong></span></p>\n<p>The following phishing scam was targeted at Servicenow users:</p>\n<pre class=\"example\">-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: &#34;SERVICENOW.ORG SUPPORT TEAM&#34; &lt;supportteam01&#64;indiana.edu&gt;\nReply-To: &#34;SERVICENOW.ORG SUPPORT TEAM&#34; &lt;spupportteam&#64;info.lt&gt;\nDate: Sat, 12 Jul 2008 17:42:05 -0400\nTo: &lt;&#34;Undisclosed-Recipient:;&#34;&#64;iocaine.uits.indiana.edu&gt;\nSubject: CONFIRM YOUR ACCOUNT\n\nDear SERVICENOW.ORG Webmail Subscriber\n\nThis mail is to inform all our {SERVICENOW.ORG} webmail users that we\nwill be maintaining and upgrading our website in a couple of days from\nnow.As a Subscriber you are required to send us your Email account\ndetails to enable us know if you are still making use of your\nmailbox.

Some people refer to this kind of communication as junk email to equate it with the paper junk mail that comes through the US Mail.

It is critical that you pause and think before replying to any spam. Consider the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul><li>Setting up your email account to generate automatic responses while you are away can have the unfortunate side-effect of verifying your email address to every spammer that sends you spam. </li><li>If the message appears to come from a legitimate company, the company may have obtained your email address from some transaction between you and the company. In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn&#39;t check a box marked <span class=\"menuitem\">Don&#39;t send me product updates</span>). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list. </li><li>If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company&#39;s site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message. </li><li>If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source, never respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often.</li></ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used</span></h2>\n<p>Every time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information.</p>\n<p>Otherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul><li>Subscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated. </li><li>Think twice before offering your email address to a web site. You may wish to check the site&#39;s privacy policy first to be sure it uses secure technology, and that the company does not share your email address with others. </li><li>If you need to list email addresses on your web site, present the addresses in a way that makes them less vulnerable to collection and abuse by spammers.</li><li>Every time you are asked for your email address verbally or on paper, think carefully about whether or not you want to receive any information from that company or organization. It is usually best to decline to provide your email address. </li><li>Whenever possible, advocate that organizations you are involved in or do business with default to the opt-in model. This requires you to specifically request to be added to their email lists, rather than the opt-out model, where they add you to email lists automatically, and then give you the option of asking to be removed. </li></ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be proactive</span></h2>\n<p>Adjusting the security settings in your web browser is a good preventive measure. For a higher level of security, have your browser disallow:</p>\n<ul><li>Accepting cookies</li><li>Listing your name and other personal information in your browser profile</li><li>Filling in form fields for you</li></ul>\n<p>This will help reduce the amount of personal information transmitted to sites at the expense of full functionality, since many legitimate web sites require you to accept cookies.</p>\n<p>Do not contribute to the spam problem by producing any of it yourself! In particular, learn about chain mail and do not forward chain mail to others. Also, if you receive an email message that appears to warn of some horrible thing happening (a virus that reportedly deletes all your files, for example) or is a touching sob story (about helping to save a poor sick girl or boy, for example), be suspicious.</p>\n<p>Nearly every instance of chain mail is a hoax. The message may even come from someone you know and respect who is simply not aware that it&#39;s a hoax. Learn about hoaxes and the sites available to verify hoaxes, and do not forward them to others. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Questions regarding X-rated spam (unsolicited mass e-mail)</span></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some members of the Company have at times expressed concern to IT regarding their own accountability for unsolicited e-mail of a sexual nature sent to their Company e-mail address. In some cases, an employee worries that a supervisor or co-worker might think the employee solicited the mail. In other cases, the person fears that an IT employee asked to assist with the computer might think the person had solicited the sexually-oriented mail.</p>\n<p>Most people who either have experienced spam or have read about spam understand that spammers do not wait to be asked; they are in the business of aggressive marketing. Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it.</p>\n<p>If a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and/or filter your incoming e-mail.  It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive.</p>"}},{"node":{"path":"/know/207de43187032100deddb882a2e3ec7a/","id":"207de43187032100deddb882a2e3ec7a","sys_id":"207de43187032100deddb882a2e3ec7a","short_description":"Create An Email Signature\t\t","number":"KB0000024","kb_category":"Outlook 2010","kb_knowledge_base":"IT","author":"Ron Kettering","published":"2014-09-09","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Create An Email Signature</span></strong></p>\n<p>To create a personalized email signature:</p>\n<ol><li>Open a new message.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.</p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>But what if I own legal copies of the material?</b></span></p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.</p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>What is legal to download?</b></span></p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>How will the rights-holder know?</b></span></p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.</p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.</p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>What happens if I get caught?</b></span></p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.</p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.</p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?</b></span></p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.</p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.</p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.</p>\n<p> </p>"}},{"node":{"path":"/know/0dd6457187032100deddb882a2e3ecb3/","id":"0dd6457187032100deddb882a2e3ecb3","sys_id":"0dd6457187032100deddb882a2e3ecb3","short_description":"Where can I obtain updates and new releases?\n\t\t","number":"KB0000012","kb_category":"How To","kb_knowledge_base":"IT","author":"Sam Sorokin","published":"2014-09-09","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Where can I obtain updates and new releases for Mac OS X?</strong></span><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> </span></p>\n<p>To find updates and new releases for Mac OS X, try any of the following options:</p>\n<ul><li>Use Software Update to download and install updates, and even full releases, of the operating system. </li><li>To download the full version of Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), open the Mac App Store, available in Mac OS X 10.6.6 and later.

The message may even come from someone you know and respect who is simply not aware that it&#39;s a hoax. Learn about hoaxes and the sites available to verify hoaxes, and do not forward them to others. <br /><br /></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Questions regarding X-rated spam (unsolicited mass e-mail)</strong></p>\n<p> Some members of the Company have at times expressed concern to IT regarding their own accountability for unsolicited e-mail of a sexual nature sent to their Company e-mail address. In some cases, an employee worries that a supervisor or co-worker might think the employee solicited the mail. In other cases, the person fears that an IT employee asked to assist with the computer might think the person had solicited the sexually-oriented mail.</p>\n<p>Most people who either have experienced spam or have read about spam understand that spammers do not wait to be asked; they are in the business of aggressive marketing. Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it.</p>\n<p>If a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and/or filter your incoming e-mail.  It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive.</p>"}},{"node":{"path":"/know/032a4adbb3531300e64be12b86a8dc10/","id":"032a4adbb3531300e64be12b86a8dc10","sys_id":"032a4adbb3531300e64be12b86a8dc10","short_description":"Instance Security Center - Resources (incl.
